# Laravel Homestead + MongoDB + SailsJS

I added MongoDB and SailsJS to Homestead.
After importing or creating a Sails-Project, run 'sudo npm install --no-bin-links' in the project root, since windows does not support bin-links.
After that use 'sails lift' as always.

Official documentation [is located here](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead?version=4.2).
